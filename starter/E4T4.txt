# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
To reduce the internet facing attack of the web application we can move it to a private subnet. This way the application instance will not have a public ip address and will only receive requests from the application load balancer.


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
The VPC private endpoints will create a way to allow the application server to access the bucket without exist the VPC, but this will NOT prevent the unauthorized access.
To prevent this it is necessary to change the bucket permission to Block all public access


# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Applying the default encryption will not change the existent object on the bucket. Only new objects will be encrypted.


# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
